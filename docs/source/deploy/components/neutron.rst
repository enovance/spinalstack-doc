Floating IP network
-------------------

=========================================== ================================ =======
Configuration                               Description                      Default
=========================================== ================================ =======
floating_network_name                       Name of floating IP network      unset
floating_network_subnet                     IP Subnet of floating IP network unset
floating_network_start                      First IP of floating IP subnet   unset
floating_network_end                        Last IP of floating IP subnet    unset
floating_network_gateway                    Gateway of floating IP subnet    unset
=========================================== ================================ =======

If floating_network_name is defined, we require all floating_* parameters defined below.
The Sanity process will ensure that the floating IP network is created, in order for Javelin to spawn servers and test connectivity.
If none of these parameters are defined, Javelin won't create server resources during Sanity process.


L3 Agent HA
-----------

=========================================== ================================ =======
Configuration                               Description                      Default
=========================================== ================================ =======
neutron_l3_ha_enabled                       Enable/disable HA with VRRP_     false
neutron_l3_ha_vrrp_auth_type                VRRP auth type                   PASS
neutron_ha_vrrp_auth_password               VRRP auth password               -
neutron_l3_allow_automatic_l3agent_failover Enable/disable auto rescheduling false
neutron_l3_agent_mode                       Working agent for the agent      legacy
enable_distributed_routing                  Enable/disable DVR_              false
enable_l2_population                        Enable/disable L2 population     true
=========================================== ================================ =======

.. warning::
    The upgrade process makes it possible to enable L3 HA if it was previously disabled on your setup, except if you've activated the L2 population mechanism driver. If you really need to activate L3 HA on your setup, we recommend you either doing a fresh install or disabling the L2 population driver.

.. warning::
    In OpenStack Juno, DVR & VRRP can't work together. That means you can't enable neutron_l3_ha_enabled and enable_distributed_routing in the same time. If you try to do it, Puppet will fail to avoid any configuration error.

.. warning::
    In OpenStack Juno, VRRP can't work with l2population mechanism driver. Ensure neutron_mechanism_drivers parameter does not contain l2population in the array and enable_l2_population is at false. Please read this blogpost_ for more informations about HA compatiblity.

.. note::
    neutron_l3_allow_automatic_l3agent_failover allows to re-schedule virtual routers if a Neutron L3 agent goes down.
    If neutron_l3_ha_enabled is enabled, this is not useful to enable neutron_l3_allow_automatic_l3agent_failover.
