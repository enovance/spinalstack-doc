rabbit_password          RabbitMQ password                                        rabbitpassword
rabbit_cluster_node_type RabbitMQ cluster node type                               disc
rabbit_port              Port on which RabbitMQ will listen on                    5672
rabbit_ip                Ip address of RabbitMQ interface                         IP of the node it is one

Upgrade from I.1.3.0 to J.1.0.0
-------------------------------

This is a special note when upgrading from I.1.3.0 to J.1.0.0.
Due to the new puppetlabs-rabbitmq implementation, a new parameter is now required in the environment file: erlang_cookie.

If you are already running Spinal Stack I.1.3.0 and you want to upgrade to J.1.0.0, you will have to look at the current content of /var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie and copy it to erlang_cookie parameter, so your upgrade will work correctly. If you miss that part, Spinal Stack will take care of re-building the RabbitMQ cluster, but you'll have to expect some downtime.

If you miss the parameter in your env, config-tools scripts (configure.sh) will fail to run. It prevents to install Spinal Stack without cookie so RabbitMQ-server could not work properly.
